<a name="Intro"><h2>Introduction</h2></a>
<p/>This is the third in a series of articles on a class library for
ASP.NET applications that I have developed. It contains a set of common,
reusable page classes that can be utilized in web applications as-is to
provide a consistent look, feel, and set of features. New classes can also
be derived from them to extend their capabilities. The features are all
fairly modular and may be extracted and placed into your own classes too.
For a complete list of articles in the series along with a demonstration
application and the code for the classes, see <a href="EWSWebPt1.asp">Part
1</a>  [<a href="EWSWebPt1.asp" target=_blank>^</a> ].

<p/>For the e-mail part of the demo, you will need the SMTP service on the
web server or access to a separate SMTP server. The error page demos use an
e-mail address stored in the <i>Web.config</i> file that is currently set
to a dummy address. You should modify the address specified by the
<code>ErrorRptEMail</code> key in the <code>appSettings</code> section to
make it valid. The e-mail page class can also use an optional configuration
option to control the name of the SMTP server
(<code>EMailPage_SmtpServer</code>).

<a name="EMP"><h2>The BasePage Class E-Mail Features</h2></a>
<p/>This article describes the features of the <code>BasePage</code> class
that allow it to e-mail its rendered content.  This article will identify
and describe the added features present in this class.  The class can be
used as-is, or the functionality can be extracted and added to your own
page classes.

<a name="EMPCommon"><h3>Two Common Approaches</h3></a>
<p/>One common approach to e-mailing the rendered content of a page is to
use the <code>WebRequest</code> and <code>WebResponse</code> objects as
follows:

<pre lang="cs">
// Create a request for the page that you want
WebRequest wreq = System.Net.HttpWebRequest.Create(
    "http://www.mysite.com/mypage.html");

// Get the response
WebResponse wrsp = wreq.GetResponse()

// Get the HTML for the page
StreamReader sr = new StreamReader(wrsp.GetResponseStream())
string strHTML = sr.ReadToEnd()
sr.Close()

// Send it by e-mail
MailMessage msg = new MailMessage();
msg.From = "Somebody@Domain.com"
msg.To = "Anyone@Domain.com"
msg.Subject = "HTML page"
msg.Body = strHTML;
msg.BodyFormat = MailFormat.Html;
SmtpMail.Send(msg);
</pre>

<p/>Another common approach is to override the page's <code>Render</code>
event and use code similar to the following:

<pre lang="cs">
// Create a string builder to contain the HTML
StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
HtmlTextWriter htw =
    new HtmlTextWriter(new StringWriter(sb));

// Render the page to it
base.Render(htw);

string strHTML = sb.ToString();

// Send it by e-mail
MailMessage msg = new MailMessage();
msg.From = "Somebody@Domain.com"
msg.To = "Anyone@Domain.com"
msg.Subject = "HTML page"
msg.Body = strHTML;
msg.BodyFormat = MailFormat.Html;
SmtpMail.Send(msg);

// And finally, write the HTML to original writer
writer.Write(strHTML);
</pre>

<p/>While these methods work, they do have some limitations:
<ul>
    <li>The code must be added to each page that needs it, and they do not
    provide for easily extending or overriding the behavior of the
    e-mailing process.

    <li>They may run into difficulties if the page being e-mailed takes
    parameters via some method other than the query string (i.e., via the
    page's <code>Context</code> object).

    <li>Any relative URLs in the message body will most likely render as
    broken links, images, or missing stylesheets when the recipient views
    the e-mail unless you take steps to fix them up.

    <li>View state is still present in the message body unnecessarily
    increasing its size.

    <li>Script blocks within the message body are still present and may
    cause security alerts in the recipient's e-mail client software unless
    you remove them.</li>
</ul>

<a name="EMPBenefits"><h3>The BasePage Class Benefits</h3></a>
<p/>The <code>BasePage</code> class provides the following benefits:

<ul>
    <li>The e-mailing behavior is built into the page class so that you do
    not have to write all of the code to do it.

    <li>The e-mailing behavior can be turned on or off using the
    <code>EMailRenderedPage</code> property. When disabled (the default),
    the page renders itself to the browser in the normal fashion. When
    enabled, the page attempts to e-mail a copy of itself in addition to
    rendering itself to the browser.

    <li>The page raises an event that lets you customize or totally replace
    the HTML rendered to the client browser as well as the mail message
    parameters and the HTML content sent as the mail message's body text.
    This allows you to easily render content for the mail message and then
    display something totally different to the browser such as a
    confirmation that the message has been sent.

    <li>The page raises an event if the e-mail cannot be sent thus letting
    you adjust the HTML rendered to the browser to indicate the problem or
    to take alternate action. Support is also built in to attempt a retry
    of the send after making adjustments to the e-mail such as changing the
    SMTP server used.

    <li>All relative URLs within the mail message body are translated to
    absolute URLs to prevent broken links when viewed by the recipient.

    <li>The HTML in the mail message body will have the view state removed
    to reduce its size.

    <li>Script blocks are removed from the mail message body so as not to
    cause unnecessary warnings from the recipient's e-mail client software.

    <li>Through the use of a custom comment tag, you can have the page
    remove unwanted sections of the page from the mail message body. This
    approach can be extended in derived classes to further alter the
    message body and the HTML rendered to the browser.</li>
</ul>

<a name="EMPHow"><h2>How It Works</h2></a>
<p/>The class consists of a property called <code>EMailRenderedPage</code>
that controls whether or not the page will attempt to e-mail itself,
an <code>IsRenderingForEMail</code> property that can be checked to see if
the page is currently in the process of rendering itself in preparation for
e-mailing, an <code>EMailThisPage</code> event that lets you customize all
aspects of the e-mail, an <code>EMailError</code> event that lets you handle
situations in which an error occurs and the e-mail could not be sent, an
overridden <code>Render</code> method, and a <code>RenderForEMail</code>
method that makes it all happen.

<a name="EMPProp"><h3>The EMailRenderedPage Property</h3></a>
<p/>This property is set to <code lang="cs">false</code> by default so that
the page renders itself to the browser in the normal fashion. You can set
it to <code lang="cs">true</code> in the constructor, the
<code>Page_Load</code> event, or an event handler for a derived page, to
have it attempt to e-mail its rendered content.

<a name="EMPRender"><h3>The Render Method</h3></a>
<p/>The overridden <code>Render</code> method controls the e-mailing
process. In all likelihood, you will never override this method. Instead,
you can control the e-mail details and rendered content by adding handlers
for the <code>EMailThisPage</code> and the <code>EMailError</code> events.
Note that the <code>BasePage</code> class's version of this method also
calls the <code>ConvertValMsgsToLinks</code> method that converts
validation messages to links.  This is described in
<a href="EWSWebPt4.asp">part four</a>.  The <code>IsRenderingForEmail</code>
property is checked to see if we are already rendering for e-mailing.  If
so, it simply renders the page as normal.  If not, it checks the
<code>EMailRenderedPage</code> property and, if necessary, calls the
<code>RenderForEMail</code> method to handle all of the work.

<pre lang="cs">
protected override void Render(HtmlTextWriter writer)
{
    // If already rendering for e-mail, just render the page
    if(!this.IsRenderingForEMail)
    {
        this.ConvertValMsgsToLinks();

        // Rendering normally or going to e-mail?
        if(this.EMailRenderedPage)
        {
            this.RenderForEMail(writer);
            return;
        }
    }

    base.Render(writer);
}
</pre>

<a name="EMPRenderForEMail"><h3>The RenderForEMail Method</h3></a>
This method handles all of the details of rendering the page, e-mailing it,
and handling any errors that might occur.  Note that the code shown below
is from the .NET 1.1 version of the class.  The .NET 2.0 version is almost
identical except for a few minor changes with regard to how the e-mail is
sent.  In .NET 2.0, it makes use of the new <code>System.Net.Mail</code>
classes to send the e-mail.

<pre lang="cs">
protected void RenderForEMail(HtmlTextWriter writer)
{
    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
    HtmlTextWriter hw = new HtmlTextWriter(
        new StringWriter(sb, CultureInfo.InvariantCulture));

    try
    {
        isRenderingForEMail = true;
        this.Render(hw);
    }
    finally
    {
        isRenderingForEMail = false;
    }

    MailMessage msg = new MailMessage();

    // The string builder contains all of the HTML
    msg.BodyFormat = MailFormat.Html;
    msg.Body = sb.ToString();

    EMailPageEventArgs args =
        new EMailPageEventArgs(msg, this);

    // Get the SMTP server from the Web.config file
    // if specified
    args.SmtpServer = ConfigurationSettings.AppSettings[
        "EMailPage_SmtpServer"];

    // Give the derived page a chance to modify or cancel
    // the e-mail.
    this.OnEMailThisPage(args);
</pre>

<p/>The first thing that occurs is to render the page to a
<code>StringBuilder</code>.  This is accomplished by setting the
<code>IsRenderingForEMail</code> property to true and calling the
<code>Render</code> method again with an HTML text writer that we created
locally.  Next, a new <code>MailMessage</code> object is created, the
format is set to HTML, and the rendered content is set as the message body.
An <code>EMailPageEventArgs</code> object is then created and is sent as
the parameter for the <code>EmailThisPage</code> event. This will be
covered shortly.

<pre lang="cs">
if(args.Cancel == false)
{
    // Try sending until it succeeds or told to stop
    do
    {
        try
        {
            // Turn off retry so we don't get stuck here.
            // The error event handler must turn it on if
            // a retry is wanted.
            args.RetryOnFailure = false;

            // It has to come from somebody
            if(msg.From == null || msg.From.Length == 0)
                throw new ArgumentNullException("From",
                    "A sender must be specified for " +
                    "the e-mail message");

            // It has to go to somebody
            if(msg.To == null || msg.To.Length == 0)
                throw new ArgumentNullException("To",
                    "A recipient must be specified for " +
                    "the e-mail message");

            // Set the server?
            if(args.SmtpServer != null &&
              args.SmtpServer.Length != 0)
                SmtpMail.SmtpServer = args.SmtpServer;

            SmtpMail.Send(msg);
        }
        catch(Exception excp)
        {
            // Raise an EMailError event if it fails so that
            // the derived page can take any action it wants
            // including a retry.
            EMailErrorEventArgs err = new EMailErrorEventArgs(
                args, excp);
            this.OnEMailError(err);
        }

    } while(args.RetryOnFailure == true);
}

// And finally, write the HTML to the original writer.
// It's rendered from the event args in case the handler
// modified it.
writer.Write(args.RenderedContent);
</pre>

<p/>The <code>EMailThisPage</code> event can be cancelled. Whether or not
the event is cancelled, it renders the content to the browser but does so
from the event argument class' <code>RenderedContent</code> property rather
than the <code>StringBuilder</code>. This allows the event handler in the
derived class to modify the HTML sent to the browser. For example, you may
want to insert a message above the page content that states that the e-mail
was sent or why it was not sent.

<p/>If e-mail is to be sent, the method checks to see if an SMTP server has
been specified in the event arguments by an event handler. If it was, it
will use this server name when sending the e-mail. This is useful in
situations where your IIS server is not set up to be an SMTP mail server.
It also checks to see if sender and recipient e-mail addresses were
specified. If not, the e-mail cannot be sent and an exception is thrown
stating that fact.

<p/>If the message is sent successfully, it renders the content to the
browser and exits as noted above. If there was an error sending the e-mail,
the method raises the <code>EMailError</code> event to give the derived
page a chance to handle the error and take alternate action. This will be
covered shortly. The error event handler also lets you modify the rendered
content to add additional information as to the cause of the error, or make
changes and attempt to resend the message.

<a name="EMPEvents"><h2>E-Mail Event Handlers</h2></a>
<a name="EMPEMail"><h3>The EMailThisPage Event</h3></a>
<p/>This event is raised whenever the page wants to e-mail its content. You
should always add a handler for this event so that your page can, at the
very least, specify the sender and recipient of the e-mail. Without them,
the e-mail cannot be sent. The event passes a custom event arguments class
called <code>EMailPageEventArgs</code> that allows the handler to modify
the e-mailed content, the rendered content, set the SMTP server, or cancel
the event altogether. In its simplest form, the handler will look something
like the following. The demo contains some more complex examples.

<pre lang="cs">
// This event fires when the page is ready to be e-mailed
void Page_EMailThisPage(Object sender,
  EWSoftware.Web.EMailPageEventArgs args)
{
    // Set the SMTP server if running locally for testing
    if(Page.Request.ServerVariables["HTTP_HOST"] == "localhost")
        args.SmtpServer = "REALSMTPSERVER"

    // Set sender, recipient, and subject
    args.EMail.From = "Somebody@Domain.com"
    args.EMail.To = "Anyone@Domain.com"
    args.EMail.Subject = this.PageTitle
}
</pre>

<p/>The event argument class' properties and methods are described below.

<ul class=property>
    <li><code lang="cs">public bool Cancel</code>
    <p/>This Boolean property can be set to <code lang="cs">true</code> to
    cancel the event and prevent the content from being e-mailed. If
    cancelled, the HTML in the <code>RenderedContent</code> property will
    still be sent to the client's browser. You can replace it with an
    alternate response if necessary when canceling the e-mail (i.e., to
    redirect the user to another location, etc.).

    <li><code lang="cs">public string SmtpServer</code>
    <p/>This property lets you set the SMTP server that should be used when
    sending the e-mail. It is usually only necessary to set this property
    if you are running the application on <b>localhost</b> or if your IIS
    server is not configured with the SMTP service.

    <li><code lang="cs">public MailMessage EMail</code>
    <p/>This property gives you access to the e-mail message object. Use it
    to set the sender, recipient, and subject and also to modify the
    message body. The <code>Body</code> property of the returned
    <code>MailMessage</code> will contain the HTML that will be sent in the
    e-mail. You can modify it as needed.

    <li><code lang="cs">public string RenderedContent</code>
    <p/>This property lets you modify the page content that will be
    rendered to the client after the e-mail is sent. Use it to alter the
    content rendered to the client's browser. For example, you may want to
    remove sections that are not relevant in the displayed content, insert
    a message telling the user that the message was sent and to whom, or
    replace the content with something entirely new.

    <li><code lang="cs">public bool RetryOnFailure</code>
    <p/>This property lets you specify whether the page should retry
    sending the e-mail if it fails. It is set to <code
    lang="cs">false</code> by default. It is also set to <code
    lang="cs">false</code> before each send attempt in order to help
    prevent an endless loop in case you forget to turn it off. Set this to
    <code lang="cs">true</code> in the error event handler to have the page
    retry sending the e-mail based on changes you make to the message
    properties or the SMTP server property.

    <li><code lang="cs">public int RetryCount</code>
    <p/>This property can be used to track how many times an attempt to
    send the e-mail has failed. You can increment it in the error event
    handler and use its value to determine when to stop trying.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Constructors</h3>
<p/>You will not create an instance of this class yourself. Instead, the
page's <code>RenderForEMail</code> method does it for you and fills in the
necessary parameters. When created by the page, the instance will take the
following steps to alter the e-mail message body and the rendered content.

<ul>
    <li>The e-mail body is processed to remove any HTML between <code
    lang="html">&lt;!-- NOEMAIL --&gt;</code> comment tags. This can be
    used to automatically note sections of the page that should not be
    included in the e-mail but should be rendered to the browser. The demo
    contains examples of this.

    <li>Since it serves no purpose, the view state tag is removed from the
    e-mail body to reduce its size.

    <li>It is a fairly safe assumption that script within an e-mail is
    frowned upon and most, if not all, e-mail clients will block the script
    from running to prevent viruses. As such, all script tag blocks are
    removed from the e-mail body.

    <li>An attempt is made to translate relative URLs to absolute URLs on
    all occurrences of <code lang="html">src</code> and <code
    lang="html">href</code> attributes so that links, images, and
    stylesheets within the page will function as expected when viewed in
    the e-mail by the recipient. I do not guarantee 100% coverage, but it
    should catch and translate the vast majority of them.</li>
</ul>

<a name="EMPError"><h3>The EMailError Event</h3></a>
<p/>Handling this event is optional. A handler for it can be added if you
would like to alter the rendered page, take alternate action if the e-mail
fails to get sent, or make changes and attempt to retry sending the e-mail.
The event passes a custom event arguments class called
<code>EMailErrorEventArgs</code> that allows the handler to examine the
cause of the exception. It is derived from <code>EventArgs</code> and
contains two properties.

<p/>The first is <code>EMailEventArguments</code> which is a copy of the
event arguments object sent to the <code>EMailThisPage</code> event. Any
of the properties described above can be examined or modified. To retry
sending the e-mail, set the <code>RetryOnFailure</code> property to <code
lang="cs">true</code>. You can also increment the <code>RetryCount</code>
property to keep track of how many times you have attempted to resend the
message.

<p/>The second property in this class is <code>EMailException</code>, which
returns an <code>Exception</code> object containing the details about the
problem that was encountered. The demo contains some examples of its use.

<a name="EMPConnect"><h3>Connecting The Event Handlers</h3></a>
The .NET 1.1 version contains a delegate for both events.  The .NET 2.0
version of the class makes use of the generic event handler type. As such,
hooking up the events has a slightly different syntax in the .NET 2.0
version:

<pre lang="cs">
// .NET 1.1
this.EMailThisPage += new EMailThisPageEventHandler(
    this.Page_EMailThisPage);
this.EMailError += new EMailErrorEventHandler(
    this.Page_EMailError);

// .NET 2.0
this.EMailThisPage += new EventHandler&lt;EMailPageEventArgs&gt;(
    this.Page_EMailThisPage);
this.EMailError += new EventHandler&lt;EMailErrorEventArgs&gt;(
    this.Page_EMailError);
</pre>

<a name="Conclude"><h2>Conclusion</h2></a>
<p/>E-mailing the contents of a rendered page is useful in many situations.
The demo application contains some common usage examples such as for the
custom error page, user feedback, generating and e-mailing a report, etc.
By using this class, you can easily add this ability to any web form in
your application. Hopefully, you will find this class and the others in the
library, or parts of them, as useful as I have.

        <li>Based on a suggestion from Lynn Evans, I have reworked the
        <code>EMailPage</code> class to support a retry operation if the
        initial send fails.  This can be controlled by the new
        <code>RetryOnFailure</code> and <code>RetryCount</code> properties
        on the <code>EMailPageEventArgs</code> class.

        <p/><b>NOTE:</b> This introduces breaking changes to the
        <code>EMailErrorEventArgs</code> class.  It is now derived from
        <code>EventArgs</code> and contains an
        <code>EMailEventArguments</code> property that lets you access and
        modify the e-mail event arguments (i.e. to increment the retry
        count and specify that it should retry on return, etc).</li>
